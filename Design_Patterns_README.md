# Design Patterns 


---

## ðŸ”¹ KVC (Key-Value Coding)
- **What**: A way to access object properties indirectly using string keys.
- **Why**: Provides flexibility when property names are unknown at compile time.
- **When**: When dealing with dynamic data like JSON or reflection.
- **Where**: Common in Swift/Objective-C applications.
- **Who**: Developers needing dynamic property access.
- **Real-Life Example**: Like a **dictionary** in a library â€“ you donâ€™t know the exact page but you look up information using a keyword (key).

---

## ðŸ”¹ KVO (Key-Value Observing)
- **What**: A mechanism to observe property value changes.
- **Why**: Helps UI update automatically when data changes.
- **When**: Reactive programming, UI bindings.
- **Where**: iOS/macOS apps observing model changes.
- **Who**: Developers building event-driven apps.
- **Real-Life Example**: A **CCTV camera** observing a door â€“ whenever someone enters, you are notified.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Facade Pattern
- **What**: Simplifies a complex system by providing a unified interface.
- **Why**: Hides complexity from the user.
- **When**: When dealing with complex subsystems.
- **Where**: API wrappers, system utilities.
- **Who**: Developers providing easy-to-use libraries.
- **Real-Life Example**: A **TV remote** â€“ hides the complexity of circuits, giving you simple buttons like Power, Volume, and Channel.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Adapter Pattern
- **What**: Converts one interface into another.
- **Why**: Makes incompatible classes work together.
- **When**: Integrating legacy code with new systems.
- **Where**: Plug adapters, payment gateways.
- **Who**: Developers connecting different modules.
- **Real-Life Example**: A **mobile charger adapter** â€“ converts wall socket electricity into a format your phone understands.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Builder Pattern
- **What**: Step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- **Why**: Avoids complex constructors with many parameters.
- **When**: When creating customizable/complex objects.
- **Where**: Pizza builder, UI builders.
- **Who**: Developers designing configurable products.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Pizza shop** â€“ dough â†’ sauce â†’ cheese â†’ toppings â†’ bake (build step by step).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Strategy Pattern
- **What**: Defines interchangeable algorithms.
- **Why**: To choose behavior at runtime.
- **When**: When multiple solutions exist for a problem.
- **Where**: Payment methods, sorting strategies.
- **Who**: Developers building flexible systems.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Google Maps navigation** â€“ you can switch between "fastest route", "shortest route", or "avoid tolls".

---

## ðŸ”¹ Factory Pattern
- **What**: Centralized object creation without exposing logic.
- **Why**: Decouples object creation from usage.
- **When**: When you need flexibility in object creation.
- **Where**: Shape factory, car factory.
- **Who**: Developers needing scalable object creation.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Car factory** â€“ you request a Sedan or SUV, factory knows how to build it without you worrying about the process.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Command Pattern
- **What**: Encapsulates requests as objects.
- **Why**: Enables undo/redo and decoupling of sender-receiver.
- **When**: When actions should be parameterized or queued.
- **Where**: Remote controls, task schedulers.
- **Who**: Developers implementing event-driven commands.
- **Real-Life Example**: **TV remote buttons** â€“ pressing "Volume Up" sends a command object to the TV.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Composite Pattern
- **What**: Composes objects into tree structures.
- **Why**: Treats individual and composite objects uniformly.
- **When**: When dealing with hierarchical structures.
- **Where**: File systems, organization hierarchies.
- **Who**: Developers designing recursive structures.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Company hierarchy** â€“ an employee (leaf) or department (composite) both implement the same behavior like "show details".

---

## ðŸ”¹ Template Method Pattern
- **What**: Defines algorithm skeleton, letting subclasses override steps.
- **Why**: Promotes code reuse with flexibility.
- **When**: When algorithms have fixed structure but customizable steps.
- **Where**: Cooking recipes, games.
- **Who**: Developers enforcing a common algorithm structure.
- **Real-Life Example**: **Cooking recipe** â€“ boil water, add ingredients, cook â€“ the skeleton is fixed, but ingredients differ per recipe.

- **KVC/KVO** â†’ Dictionary lookup & CCTV monitoring.  
- **Facade** â†’ TV remote.  
- **Adapter** â†’ Mobile charger adapter.  
- **Builder** â†’ Pizza shop.  
- **Strategy** â†’ Google Maps routes.  
- **Factory** â†’ Car factory.  
- **Command** â†’ TV remote buttons.  
- **Composite** â†’ Company hierarchy.  
- **Template** â†’ Cooking recipe.
