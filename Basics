# Swift Basics

## What is Swift Programming Language?

Swift is a modern and open-source programming language that is specifically designed by Apple for its platforms.

---

## Basic Syntax

- Use `let` for constants and `var` for variables.
- Semicolons are optional.
- Type inference is supported by default.

```swift
print("Hello, Swift!")
```

---

## Variable

- Use `var` to declare a variable.
- You can optionally specify the type.

```swift
var name = "Rasool"
var age: Int = 25
```

---

## Constants

- Use `let` to declare a constant.
- Value cannot be changed after assignment.

```swift
let pi = 3.142
let country: String = "India"
```

---

## Literals

- **Integer**: `10`, `20`  
- **Float/Double**: `3.14`, `2.0`  
- **String**: `"Hello"`  
- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`

```swift
let intLiteral = 10
let floatLiteral = 3.14
let stringLiteral = "Swift"
let boolLiteral = true
```
